# Product list with cart 🍬

This project was created based on a Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io/] challenge. The layout and design idea come from Frontend Mentor, while the code implementation is my own.

## 📦 Technologies

- HTML5 – semantic markup and structure
- CSS3 – custom styling, responsive layout (Flexbox, Grid, media queries)
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS, ES6+) – dynamic rendering, cart logic, event handling
- JSON – product data storage and asynchronous loading
- Fetch API – for retrieving data from data.json
- Responsive Design – mobile-first approach
- Git & GitHub – version control and project hosting

## 📚 What I Learned

- Practical experience with asynchronous JavaScript (async/await, Fetch API)
- State management for a small front-end application
- DOM manipulation based on real-time user actions
- Implementing cart functionality (add, remove, update items)
- Dynamic price calculation and UI updates
- Responsive UI development using modern CSS (Flexbox & Grid)
- Code structuring and separation of concerns
- Working with real project data in JSON format

## 🚀 How It Can Be Improved?

- Add localStorage support to save cart data between page reloads
- Implement product filtering and sorting (by category or price)
- Add search functionality for menu items
- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, better keyboard navigation)
- Add loading and error states for data fetching
- Refactor code into modules for better scalability
- Add animations and transitions for smoother user experience
- Optimize performance for larger datasets
